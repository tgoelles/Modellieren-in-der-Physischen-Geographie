    "\n",
    "```{note} Reminder\n",
    "The global energy budget is the balance of energy coming into and going out of Earth, influenced mainly by the sun's radiation and Earth's reflective and absorptive properties.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, Why Does It Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Climate Change Connection**: Alterations in the energy budget directly impact global warming and weather patterns. More greenhouse gases mean more trapped energy, leading to a hotter planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-world Consequences**:\n",
    "    ```{margin} Quick Fact\n",
    "    Energy imbalances are responsible for unpredictable climate events.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - **Weather Events**: Such as powerful hurricanes and erratic rainfall.\n",
    "    - **Melting Ice Caps**: Increased energy melts polar ice, raising sea levels and altering ocean currents.\n",
    "    - **Biodiversity Risk**: Warmer regions put numerous species' habitats in danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Role of Humans**: Our actions, like burning fossil fuels and clearing forests, modify the energy budget. This heightens greenhouse gas levels and planetary temperatures. Grasping the energy budget lets us evaluate our environmental impact and consider more sustainable practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](figures/GlobalEnergyBudget.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In upcoming exercises, we'll build a basic climate model grounded in this energy budget. But first, we need a simpler version of this budget.\n",
    "\n",

    "Our rudimentary climate model can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heat Content Change** = \n",
    "    - $+$ Energy from the Sun's rays\n",
